I completed sql query from w3school.com

some syntax of sql query are -:

select syntax is used to display the data of the table

create syntax is used to create table in the database.To create a table we used 
 column_name, constraints, data type.

constraints are - unique, not null, null, primary key, foreign key etc.
data type are - int , varchar, boolean, long

where clause - is used display particular data from the table of the database.

order by - is used to display the data orderly.we use two keyword
	Asc for Ascending order 
	Desc for Descending order

Having clause - is used to add aggregate function like, count, sum, avg etc

comments - for single comments = '--'
		for multline comments = '/*---------*\ '

join is used to combine row from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Types of join -:-
	inner join - returns records that have matching value in both tables
	outer join - return all the records of both tables either matched or not
	left (innner)join -  return all the records of left table and matched 			record from the right table.
	
	right(outer)join - return all the records of right table and matched 			records from the left table.the records doesn't matched fill 			with null values.

Group by - statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, 	like "find the number of customers in each country".
	group by generally used with aggregate function like, max(),min(),count(),avg() to group the result-set by one or more column

case syntax - are similar to if-else statement. if condition is true, then 	statement is executed. if condition is false else statement is executed.

IN operator are allow you to specify multiply values in a where clause.
