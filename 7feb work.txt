Class & Objects -:-

VB.NET is an Object Oriented programming language. The Objects referred to are created from something called a Class. You've already used Classes throughout this course. But we'll now have a closer look at them.

VB.Net allows you many ways to connect to a database or a data source. The technology used to interact with a database or data source is called ADO.NET.

The ADO parts stands for Active Data Objects which, admittedly, doesnâ€™t explain much. But just like System was a Base Class (leader of a hierarchy, if you like), so is ADO. Forming the foundation of the ADO Base Class are five other major objects:
			Connection
			Command
			DataReader
			DataSet
			DataAdapter
