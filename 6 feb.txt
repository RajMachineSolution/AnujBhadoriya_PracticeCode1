Chars is a method of the String variable type. You can use it on any length of string, not just a Char variable. And that's the difference between the two: Char is a variable type, while Chars is a method you can use on Strings.

Chars works like this:

	OneCharacter = FirstName.Chars(i)


The InStr( ) method of string variables tells you what the position of one string is inside another. For example, if your string was "me@me.com" and you wanted to know if the string contained the @ symbol, you could use InStr( ) Method. You would use it like this

FirstString = "me@me.com"
SecondString = "@"

position = InStr( FirstString, SecondString )
