Private Sub btnZero_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) _
Handles btnZero.Click

	txtDisplay.Text = btnZero.Text

End Sub


This code will transfer the Text Property of a Button called btnZero to the Text Property of a Textbox called txtDisplay.


txtDisplay.Text = txtDisplay.Text & btnZero.Text   :-

So now we're saying the textbox doesn't just contain the Text on the Button. It must also keep whatever is inside the textbox as well.
